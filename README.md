# Musescore Printable Viewer Extension

## About

[Musescore](https://musescore.com) is a popular site that hosts sheet music. In order to print these sheets, one must either save each sheet's page as an image and print the images, or take a screen capture of the sheets. In order to make this process easier with no loss of quality, this Chrome extension will gather the sheet music images from the current tab and format them in a way that is printer-friendly. This is then opened in a new tab, where (in most browsers) users can save the file as a PDF, or directly print it.

## Installation

This extension can either be [sideloaded](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/), or installed directly from the Chrome web store (when/if it gets approved).

The Chromium version of Microsoft Edge should also support this extension, although it has not been tested.

## Usage

Usage is relatively straightforward: go to your desired sheet's Musescore page, click the extension if it's enabled in your browser, and click "Process Sheets".

If you run into issues, you may have to refresh the page. This project is still being tested, so it might not be completely ready yet.

## Disclaimer

Musescore offers Musescore Pro, which allows users to download sheets directly from Musescore's servers in a variety of formats (PDF, XML, .xyz). This project does not aim to circumvent this, as it simply rearranges content already loaded in the user's browser. This project and its developer do not condone the illegal distribution of copyrighted material; usage is for personal and educational use only.
